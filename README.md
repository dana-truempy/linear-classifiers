# linear-classifiers
A python implementation of the naive Bayes and logistic regression algorithms for classification. 

Data set must first be converted to a list of Observation objects, then algorithms can be run with cross-validation.
The main.py script gives an example of using the algorithms with cross-validation on several example data sets.
